# sqlalchemy_challenge_2025
This is a weekly challenge from the UC Irvine Data Analyst Bootcamp focused on SQLAlchemy, APIs, and Flask.
The goal of this project is to analyze weather data from stations in Hawaii to gain insights into:

    - Precipitation levels in 2016/2017
    - Temperature readings in 2016/2017

The second part of the project involves creating a web application that displays the data through an API.
